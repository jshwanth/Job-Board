## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or a MongoDB Atlas account)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/jshwanth/Job-Board.git](https://github.com/jshwanth/Job-Board.git)
    cd Job-Board
    ```

2.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `api` directory and install the necessary packages.
    ```sh
    cd api
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `client` directory from the root folder and install its packages.
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    In the `api` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following variables.
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string and choose a secure secret for `your_jwt_secret_key`.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    You will need two terminals to run both the client and server concurrently.

    * **In the first terminal (from the `api` directory), start the backend server:**
        ```sh
        # from /api
        npm start
        ```

    * **In the second terminal (from the `client` directory), start the React development server:**
        ```sh
        # from /client
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running, with the client available at `http://localhost:5173` and the server at `http://localhost:8000`.
